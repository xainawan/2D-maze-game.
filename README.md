This game is a grid-based adventure where the player moves around to collect a key, unlock a door, and avoid hazards such as bombs. The game starts by selecting a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard), which determines the grid size, the number of available moves, and the number of allowed undos. The player navigates through the grid using 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' to move up, left, down, and right, respectively, with the goal of collecting coins and finding a key.

Coins are randomly scattered across the grid, and collecting them rewards the player with extra moves, undos, and points. A bomb is also hidden on the grid, and stepping on it ends the game immediately. Proximity hints guide the player toward the key and the door, and an undo feature allows the player to reverse their last move if needed.

The game ends when the player collects the key and successfully reaches the door, or if they run out of moves or hit a bomb.
